BE SAFE

The aim of the thesis was to create a mobile application for finding and marking on Google 
Maps the locations where dangerous incidents occurred. Its most important advantage is the 
ability to add markers indicating locations where legal violations have occurred.
The choice of the project theme, application design, and prototyping stage were based on 
the Design Thinking method of creative problem-solving. The Scrum methodology and the Trello 
tool were used for project management. The technologies used in the project were selected for 
their compatibility with Google Maps and the Android and iOS systems. An innovative solution 
was the creation of marker interfaces in Firebase. Creative and thoughtful use of available tools 
aimed to stimulate engagement, improve user experiences, increase conversions, and optimize 
the application.
Chapter 1 outlines the background of the thesis topic. The following chapters (from 2 to 6) 
describe the process of designing and implementing the product, from defining functionalities, 
through selecting technologies and tools, to the application design. Chapter 7 summarizes the 
project and indicates its developmental possibilities. The final part of the thesis includes 
a bibliography, list of figures, and tables. Given the project's global nature, English was chosen as 
the application's language.
The final outcome of the project is the useful and functional mobile application BeSafe, 
which allows for the sharing of information among users. The application increases the sense of 
safety in public spaces, counters the risks of exposure to situations threatening health and 
property, and serves as a source of information for law enforcement services. The thoughtful 
selection of technologies and tools, interactivity, design based on the actual needs of 
respondents, and further developmental possibilities of the project are the most important values 
of the application
